## **GPS PITCH FRAMEWORK & STORY EXAMPLES**

### **Framework Structure**

**G = Grab Attention** (Hook with story)  
**P = Problem** (Top Problem → Deeper Pain → Alternatives)  
**S = Solution** (Offer → Features → Benefits → Close)

### **GPS PITCH #1: THE FOUNDER ORIGIN STORY (VANOS IMMERSION)**

**Real Story:** Corey embedded with Vanos Insulation for 2 years  
**Best For:** Trade shows, NIA conferences, authentic founder connection

#### **G | Grab Attention (Personal - True Story)**

*"For two years, I basically glued myself to the owner of a mechanical insulation company—Vanos Insulation here in Ontario. I mean literally sitting in his manufacturing facility watching him work, asking 'What are all these things?' and him patiently explaining 'Oh, these are elbows. This is how we fabricate duct insulation.' I watched him spend every Sunday night calculating union payroll across three different spreadsheets while his phone blew up with foremen texting 'Where am I supposed to be Monday morning?' I saw him chase down paper safety forms that guys swore they submitted but mysteriously vanished between the job site and the filing cabinet. That's when it hit me: these million-dollar ICI businesses are running on the same tools you'd use to plan a garage sale."*

#### **P | Problem**

**Top Problem:**
*"You know exactly what I'm talking about, right? You're juggling Excel for crew scheduling, paper timesheets that come back crumpled from field workers' pockets, union payroll calculations that take hours because Bob switched from insulator to supervisor mid-shift—and you're trying to get progress invoicing out the door so you can actually get paid this month instead of next."*

**Deeper Pain:**
*"And here's what that's actually costing you: your office staff is burning 15-20 hours every week just moving data from one system to another. Your progress billing gets delayed 1-2 weeks because nobody can consolidate all the information fast enough. You're leaving 5-15% of your revenue on the table because change orders that should've been documented in the field just... weren't. Plus, you've hit this invisible growth ceiling where adding more crews means exponentially more chaos."*

**Alternatives:**
*"So what do contractors try? Some force themselves into Procore—and I hear this constantly at conferences—subcontractors literally berating Procore reps because it's built for GCs managing them as vendors, not for managing their own operations. Or they patch together 5-6 different apps: one for time tracking, one for safety, one for equipment. Now you're drowning in integration chaos and paying more in combined subscriptions than a unified platform would cost."*

#### **S | Solution**

**Offer:**
*"That's exactly why my co-founder Ian and I built Appello—the only platform purpose-built from the ground up for ICI subcontractors."*

**Features:**
*"Everything I watched contractors struggle with for two years, we solved. One integrated platform handles your crew scheduling that cross-references certifications, mobile timesheets that automatically calculate those nightmare union wage rules—multi-classification, shift differentials, prevailing wage, travel pay—equipment tracking with QR codes, digital safety forms, real-time job costing, and progress invoicing that syncs directly to QuickBooks. Ian handles implementation in 1-2 weeks with white-glove onboarding where we do all the heavy lifting."*

**Benefits:**
*"You reclaim those 15-20 hours a week immediately. Your billing cycle accelerates by 1-2 weeks—that's cash flow hitting your account faster. You capture 100% of billable change orders because field guys document them in real-time on mobile. And here's the thing that makes me most proud: we haven't lost a single customer. Not one. Because once contractors experience software that actually understands mechanical insulation, sheet metal, HVAC work—not generic 'construction'—they can't imagine going back."*

**Close:**
*"I spent two years learning your business inside and out. Let me show you what that looks like in software form."*

---

### **GPS PITCH #2: THE "THEY HATE PROCORE" STORY**

**Real Story:** Ian's conference observations + Collins Construction feedback  
**Best For:** Procore refugees, frustrated GC-platform users, competitive situations

#### **G | Grab Attention (Proxy - Industry Truth)**

*"At the last NIA conference, I watched something fascinating happen. A subcontractor walked up to the Procore booth, and the rep started his pitch about how they support subs. The contractor cut him off mid-sentence: 'Support subs? You charge us $120,000 a year for software built to help GCs manage us like vendors. My field foremen refuse to use it because it feels like Big Brother tracking them, not tools helping them do their job.' Then he walked away. And that wasn't an isolated incident—my co-founder Ian has literally seen subcontractors berate Procore reps at multiple conferences. These are paying customers so frustrated they're publicly confronting the company."*

#### **P | Problem**

**Top Problem:**
*"If you're running a mechanical insulation, sheet metal, or HVAC business, you've probably felt this exact frustration: every major construction software platform treats you like an afterthought. They're built for general contractors managing you as a subcontractor on their projects—not for you managing your own crews, your own equipment, your own business operations."*

**Deeper Pain:**
*"Take Collins Construction—they're a great mid-sized contractor who tried making Procore work. They told us it's 'big and clunky,' doesn't handle their specific workflows, and their team finds it overwhelming. But beyond user experience, there's real money on the table: Procore costs $76,000 to $257,000 annually—that's 10 to 20 times what you should actually pay. It can't handle your complex union payroll where workers switch classifications mid-shift. It doesn't track your equipment lifecycles from manufacturing through installation through service. And when something breaks? You're ticket number 47,283 in a queue."*

**Alternatives:**
*"So what do contractors do? They either force-fit these GC tools that frustrate everyone, stay stuck in manual Excel chaos, or cobble together 5-6 specialized apps that create integration nightmares. A contractor told me last month: 'I have one app for time tracking, one for safety forms, one for equipment, one for scheduling, and they don't talk to each other. I'm STILL doing manual data entry between systems!'"*

#### **S | Solution**

**Offer:**
*"That's precisely why Appello exists—we're the platform built FOR subcontractors managing operations, not GCs managing subcontractors."*

**Features:**
*"Everything is designed around your ICI workflows: scheduling that understands mechanical insulation crew requirements, timesheets that automate those painful union payroll calculations with multi-classification and prevailing wage, equipment tracking from cradle to grave with QR codes, safety forms with conditional logic, real-time job costing, progress invoicing—all integrated with QuickBooks. And you're not ticket #47,283—you text directly with me or Ian and get responses in minutes, not days."*

**Benefits:**
*"You go live in 1-2 weeks instead of Procore's 3-6 month implementations. You pay $10 per user per month instead of $76,000 annually. You reclaim 15-20 hours weekly, accelerate billing by 1-2 weeks, and most importantly—you feel understood. Collins Construction switched to us from Procore. The difference? Software that finally knows what an ICI subcontractor actually does. That's why our churn rate is zero percent. Not low. Zero. When you experience being the customer instead of the afterthought, you don't go back."*

**Close:**
*"Let me show you what it feels like when software actually gets you—not just tolerates you as a revenue source."*

### **GPS PITCH #3: THE APEX INSULATION "NAPKIN TIMESHEET" STORY**

**Real Story:** Brandon from Apex Insulation using paper forms and Excel  
**Best For:** Manual system users, "we're fine with spreadsheets" prospects

#### **G | Grab Attention (Proxy - Relatable Pain)**

*"Last year, I demoed Appello for Brandon at Apex Insulation—nice contractor doing mechanical insulation work across Ontario. I asked him to walk me through his current process for tracking crew time. He pulled out his phone and showed me photos: actual paper timesheets, some filled out with pen, some with pencil, one—and I'm not making this up—written on the back of a Tim Hortons napkin because the foreman forgot his clipboard. Then he showed me the Excel spreadsheet where his office staff manually re-enters all this data every Monday to run payroll. When I asked how long that takes, he laughed: 'My office manager blocks her entire Monday. Eight to ten hours just typing in timesheet data.'"*

#### **P | Problem**

**Top Problem:**
*"Sound familiar? If you're running an ICI subcontractor business on manual systems—paper forms, Excel spreadsheets, scheduling through text messages—you probably think it's 'free.' But let me show you what it's actually costing you."*

**Deeper Pain:**
*"Brandon's office manager spending 10 hours every Monday on timesheet data entry? That's $25,000 per year in labor costs just moving information from paper to computer. But that's just the visible cost. You're also losing 5-15% of revenue through missed billable change orders that weren't documented properly in the field. Your progress billing is delayed 1-2 weeks because the office can't consolidate everything fast enough—that's a cash flow hit. You can't prove compliance when a GC asks for worker certification records. And you've hit a growth ceiling: adding more field crews means exponentially more of this manual chaos."*

**Alternatives:**
*"Brandon told me something interesting: 'I know we should probably get software, but every time I look into it, I get overwhelmed. Procore costs more than a truck. The cheap apps don't do what we need. And I'm worried my field guys won't use it—they're used to paper, and I don't want to fight that battle.' So he stays stuck, thinking manual is 'free' when it's actually the most expensive option."*

#### **S | Solution**

**Offer:**
*"That's exactly the problem Appello solves—ICI subcontractor operations at contractor-friendly prices with implementation that actually works."*

**Features:**
*"One integrated platform replaces Brandon's paper timesheets, Excel schedules, and text message coordination with mobile crew scheduling, automated union payroll calculations, equipment tracking with QR codes, digital safety forms, real-time job costing, and progress invoicing that syncs to QuickBooks. We implement it in 1-2 weeks with our team handling the heavy lifting—contractors invest just an hour a week during onboarding."*

**Benefits:**
*"If Brandon switches to Appello, here's what changes: his office manager's 10-hour Mondays become 2-hour Mondays—that's 32 hours per month reclaimed. Progress billing happens the same day instead of 1-2 weeks later—cash flow improves immediately. Field guys can document change orders in real-time on mobile—capturing that 5-15% revenue leakage. Certification tracking is automatic—instant compliance proof. All for $10 per user per month, which actually costs LESS than the $25,000 annually his 'free' manual system is burning. And here's what I told Brandon that sealed it: 'If your crew can text, they can use Appello.' The mobile app is that simple."*

**Close:**
*"Your manual system isn't free—it's expensive. Let me show you what modern operations look like for less than what you're paying now."*

### **GPS PITCH #4: THE UNION PAYROLL NIGHTMARE STORY**

**Real Story:** Customer pain points about complex union wage calculations  
**Best For:** Unionized contractors, payroll complexity frustrations

#### **G | Grab Attention (Specific Pain)**

*"I was on a demo call with a sheet metal contractor last month—about 40 field staff, all union. I asked the office manager to walk me through how she calculates payroll. She pulled up this monster Excel spreadsheet with tabs for different classifications, shift differentials, travel pay calculations, per diems by state, prevailing wage rate tables... and she said something that stuck with me: 'Every Sunday night, I pray I don't make a mistake. Because if I mess up someone's paycheck, especially underpaying them, I've got a union grievance on my hands. One error can cost us thousands in back pay and penalties—not to mention damaging labor relations.'"*

#### **P | Problem**

**Top Problem:**
*"If you're managing a unionized workforce in ICI construction, you know this pain intimately: the wage calculations are absolutely brutal. You've got workers switching between classifications mid-shift—Bob starts as an apprentice, finishes as a journeyman. There are shift differentials for nights and weekends. Travel pay when they work across state lines. Per diems that vary by location. Prevailing wage rules on government jobs. It's a nightmare to calculate manually."*

**Deeper Pain:**
*"And here's what's at stake: one payroll error doesn't just mean re-cutting a check—it means union grievances, back pay with penalties, damaged labor relations, and your best workers losing trust in you. That office manager I mentioned? She spends 12-15 hours every pay period just on calculations, double-checking, triple-checking. That's $30,000+ annually in labor costs. Plus, the stress is killing her—she literally said 'I don't sleep well Sunday nights.' And when she goes on vacation? The owner has to do it himself because nobody else understands the complexity."*

**Alternatives:**
*"So what do contractors try? Some use basic time tracking apps, but those can't handle multi-classification or prevailing wage complexity. Some try Procore, but it's not built for the nuances of union sub workflows. Most stay stuck in Excel because 'at least we control it'—even though it's error-prone, time-consuming, and creates a single point of failure if that one person who understands the spreadsheet leaves."*

#### **S | Solution**

**Offer:**
*"That's why Appello includes automated union payroll complexity as a core feature—not an afterthought."*

**Features:**
*"The platform handles what humans can't: multi-classification tracking where workers switch roles mid-shift, automatic shift differential calculations for nights and weekends, travel pay across state lines with different rules by location, per diem calculations, prevailing wage rate tables that update automatically, certified payroll reporting for government jobs. Workers clock in/out on mobile, select their classification, and the system calculates everything correctly—including the edge cases that break other software."*

**Benefits:**
*"That office manager I mentioned? She'd go from 12-15 hours per pay period to maybe 2 hours—just reviewing and approving what the system calculated automatically. That's $25,000+ per year in reclaimed labor costs. Sunday night anxiety disappears because the math is guaranteed correct. Union grievances drop to near-zero because workers are paid accurately, on time, every time. The owner can actually take a vacation without worrying about payroll. And when that office manager eventually retires, there's no institutional knowledge loss—it's all in the system."*

**Close:**
*"Nobody should lose sleep over payroll calculations. Let me show you what automated union complexity looks like—it'll change your Sunday nights forever."*

### **GPS PITCH #5: THE ZERO CHURN STORY (CUSTOMER RETENTION PROOF)**

**Real Story:** Ian's "we've yet to lose a customer" track record  
**Best For:** Risk-averse buyers, implementation failure concerns, proof-focused prospects

#### **G | Grab Attention (Surprising Stat)**

*"My co-founder Ian says something on every single demo call that stops prospects in their tracks: 'We've yet to lose a customer. Not a single one.' People think he's exaggerating, so they ask: 'Wait, seriously? Zero churn? What's your actual retention rate?' And he shows them the data: 100%. Now, we're not a massive company—we've got 25 contractors using Appello—but that's 25 out of 25 who are still with us, some for over two years. In an industry where software implementation has a 30% failure rate, where contractors try platforms and abandon them within six months, where 'buyer's remorse' is practically a given... we have zero failures."*

#### **P | Problem**

**Top Problem:**
*"If you're evaluating construction software, you're probably terrified of making the wrong choice. You've heard the horror stories: contractors spending $120,000 on Procore and four months implementing it, only to have field teams refuse to use it. Companies buying point solutions that don't integrate. Platforms that promised the world during the demo but fell apart in real operations. You've maybe even tried something yourself that didn't work out."*

**Deeper Pain:**
*"And the cost of a failed software implementation isn't just the money—though that hurts. It's the time your team invested learning the system. It's the trust you lose when you tell field workers 'we're switching again' for the third time. It's the opportunity cost of staying stuck in manual systems for another year because you're gun-shy about trying anything new. It's the credibility hit with your leadership or owners when they ask 'what happened to that software we bought?' One contractor told me: 'I'd rather stay in Excel hell than risk another failed implementation.'"*

**Alternatives:**
*"So contractors get paralyzed. They stick with manual systems because 'at least we know it works'—even though it's costing them $25K-50K annually in hidden labor. They avoid Procore because they've heard the subcontractor horror stories. They're skeptical of new platforms because 'what if this is just another expensive mistake?' The fear of failure becomes bigger than the pain of the status quo."*

#### **S | Solution**

**Offer:**
*"That's why our zero churn rate matters so much—it's proof that our implementation methodology actually works, every single time."*

**Features:**
*"Here's why we haven't lost anyone: we do white-glove onboarding where our team handles the heavy lifting, you invest just an hour a week. We go live in 1-2 weeks, not 3-6 months—quick wins build momentum. We're genuinely responsive—text me or Ian directly, not ticket #47283. The platform is purpose-built for ICI subcontractors, so workflows feel natural, not forced. And we're continuously improving based on customer feedback—features you request actually get built in months, not years. We've refined our onboarding process across 25 contractors, getting better every time."*

**Benefits:**
*"Zero churn means you can make this decision confidently—no other customers have regretted it. The implementation risk you're worried about? We've eliminated it through proven methodology refined across 25 successful deployments. You'll go live in 1-2 weeks seeing immediate value—reclaimed 15-20 hours weekly, faster billing, captured change orders. Your team will actually use it because it's purpose-built for your workflows, not generic 'construction.' And six months from now, you won't be looking for a replacement—you'll be wondering how you ever operated without it. Because that's what happened to the other 25."*

**Close:**
*"The question isn't whether Appello works—it's whether you're ready to experience software that finally gets ICI subcontractors. Every single customer before you is still with us. You'll be the same."*

## **STORYTELLING BEST PRACTICES**

### **The 3 Elements of Compelling Stories**

1. **SPECIFICITY** (Details create believability)
   - ❌ BAD: "Contractors waste time on payroll"
   - ✅ GOOD: "10 hours every Monday typing timesheet data from paper"

2. **EMOTION** (Feelings create connection)
   - ❌ BAD: "Manual systems are inefficient"
   - ✅ GOOD: "I don't sleep well Sunday nights—one payroll mistake means a union grievance"

3. **TRANSFORMATION** (Change creates desire)
   - ❌ BAD: "Appello saves time"
   - ✅ GOOD: "Went from 10-hour Mondays to 2-hour Mondays—reclaimed 32 hours per month"

### **Story Structure That Works**

**SETUP → CONFLICT → RESOLUTION**

**Example:**
- **Setup:** "Office manager at 40-person contractor"
- **Conflict:** "Spends 12 hours per payroll on union calculations, Sunday night anxiety, one error = grievance"
- **Resolution:** "Automated union payroll, 12 hours → 2 hours, zero errors, no more Sunday anxiety"

### **Story Adaptation Guide**

#### **Making Stories Your Own**

**Option 1: Tell as Third-Person Story**
- "Last month, a contractor told me..."
- "I was on a demo with a sheet metal company..."
- Keeps you as narrator, builds credibility

**Option 2: First-Person Experience**
- "When I was embedded with Vanos..."
- "At the last conference, I watched..."
- More personal, authentic connection

**Option 3: Direct Customer Quote**
- "A Collins Construction manager said: 'Procore is big and clunky'"
- Use actual quotes for maximum credibility
- Attribute to company (with permission) or anonymize

#### **Story Elements to Emphasize**

**Specific Details Make Stories Memorable:**
- "Tim Hortons napkin" (not just "paper")
- "Mondays, 10 hours" (not "a lot of time")
- "$120,000 for Procore" (not "expensive")
- "Ticket #47,283" (not "support queue")
- "These are elbows" (specific learning moment)

**Emotions Make Stories Resonate:**
- "I pray I don't make a mistake" (Sunday night payroll anxiety)
- "They berate them at conferences" (frustration with Procore)
- "My field foremen refuse to use it" (adoption resistance)
- "I don't sleep well Sunday nights" (stress and pressure)

**Transformation Makes Stories Persuasive:**
- Before: 10-hour Mondays → After: 2-hour Mondays
- Before: Sunday night anxiety → After: Confident automation
- Before: Ticket #47,283 → After: Text founders directly
- Before: Trying software #3 → After: Never switching again

### **Permission & Attribution Guide**

#### **When to Use Company Names**

**WITH Permission (confirmed customers):**
- Vanos Insulation (Appello's origin story - public knowledge)
- Collins Construction (mentioned in meeting notes)
- Apex Insulation (if Brandon approves)

**WITHOUT Permission (anonymize):**
- "A 40-person sheet metal contractor in Ontario..."
- "A mechanical insulation company I worked with..."
- "One of our customers told me..."

#### **When to Use Specific Numbers**

**Safe to Use:**
- Zero churn rate (verified fact)
- 25 current customers (public information)
- $10/user/month pricing (published)
- Procore $76K-257K/year (competitor public data)
- 1-2 week implementation (standard promise)

**Verify First:**
- Specific customer time savings (get permission)
- Revenue impact numbers (anonymize or confirm)
- Customer names and details (always ask)

## **CUSTOMER STORIES & SOCIAL PROOF**

### **Real Customer Quotes**

#### **On Manual Systems (Apex Insulation)**
*"We're highly manual using Excel or paper basis. Scheduling and information sharing is ad hoc through calls and texts. No centralized system for safety forms, equipment tracking, document storage."* - Brandon, Apex Insulation

#### **On Procore Frustration (Conference Observations)**
*"Our feedback is generally within subcontractor: they hate using it. They don't want to talk to those guys. They berate them at conferences."* - Ian Haase, Appello Co-Founder

*"Procore is big and clunky and more than we need."* - Collins Construction

#### **On Implementation Success (Customer Retention)**
*"We've yet to lose a customer. Customer service is our number one focus."* - Ian Haase, Appello Co-Founder

#### **On Learning the Business (Founder Immersion)**
*"I basically glued myself to the owner of an installation company for about two years inside of that thing. I'm like, okay, what are all these things? He's like, oh, these are elbows."* - Corey Shelson, Appello CEO

#### **On Union Complexity (Customer Pain Points)**
*"There's sometimes some pretty complex calculations on how to calculate their timesheets. Navigating nuances of unionized agreements."* - Customer Demo Discussion

#### **On Customer-Driven Development (Rapid Feature Building)**
*"Progress billing, monthly draws and progress reports—that wasn't something we had in the platform three months ago. But it came to us from several customers: we want this, this will solve a problem, we're going to save a ton of time. We did customer interviews, mocked it up, showed it to them, they said 'yeah, that is what we want,' and then we built it."* - Corey Shelson

#### **On Onboarding Improvement (Getting Better Every Time)**
*"Every customer that we do, the actual onboarding process is getting easier because we're either simplifying the platform, realizing things that we were doing before were stupid and just removing them or making them better, or we're building little tools to onboard it."* - Corey Shelson

### **Case Study: Vanos Insulations**

**Challenge:**
*"Before Appello, managing timecards and payroll was chaos. Paper forms, late submissions, and endless follow-ups slowed everything down. Just collecting data each week felt like a full-time job."*

**Solution:**
*"Appello centralized every workflow—timecards, scheduling, payroll, and reporting. Now, everything is digital, accurate, and accessible from anywhere. What once took days now takes minutes."*

**Results:**
- Payroll now runs with just one administrator
- Two additional staff freed up to focus on higher-value work
- Accuracy is up, stress is down
- Whole operation runs smoother

**Quote:**
*"Before Appello, payroll was chaos... Now, everything's in one place. One person runs payroll, two others have time for real work, and if we ever need help, support gets back to us instantly. It's completely changed how our office runs."* - Brianne Ernewein, Accounting & HR Manager, Vanos Insulations

### **Case Study: R.A. Barnes Electrical Contractors**

**Challenge:**
*"Communication issues. Managing schedules, timecards, and payroll across multiple apps was messy and slow. Admin staff spent hours every week chasing updates and fixing errors."*

**Solution:**
*"Appello replaced six disconnected systems with one platform. Scheduling, timesheets, and safety tracking now happen in a single app—accessible anywhere."*

**Results:**
- Tasks that took hours now take minutes
- Team eliminated a full-time admin role
- Saved thousands each year
- Field staff stay connected without endless calls or emails

**Quote:**
*"Appello completely changed how we run our jobs. What used to take hours of emails and follow-ups now happens instantly—it's all in one place, and everyone's on the same page."* - Katharine Barnes, Vice President

**Video:** "R.A. Barnes Electric x Appello Case Study"

### **Testimonial: Matthew Vanos**

*"Appello has completely changed the game for us. We made the switch and have been amazed by the powerful features and user-friendliness of this platform. If you have field workers, you have to give Appello a try."* - Matthew Vanos, President (3rd Generation), Vanos Insulations
