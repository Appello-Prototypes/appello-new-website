## **CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS & QUOTES**

### **Time Savings & Efficiency**

**Anonymous Customer (Board Meeting):**
*"Of all the things I use Appello for, I'd probably say my favorite part of it is the fact that it's one app that stops me from using probably six other devices or apps or browsers. I've got everything in one place. We've saved a lot of money being able to get rid of those other platforms. I would say Appello has been a massive time saver for us. It's streamlining processes and eliminating steps that everybody needs to take and that people would have to remember."*

**Key Points:**
- One app replaces six other devices/apps/browsers
- Significant cost savings from eliminating other platforms
- Massive time saver
- Streamlines processes and eliminates unnecessary steps

**Customer Feedback on Responsiveness:**
*"Whenever Louise or I would ask if you were able to do something and it wasn't currently offered under the platform, it was always a possibility. And we have seen that come to fruition time and time again since we started using you."*

**Key Points:**
- Customer-driven feature development
- Responsive to requests
- Features actually get built (not just promised)

### **Platform Consolidation**

**Customer Quote:**
*"We're looking for something that could help streamline all of the processes and integrate the processes from scheduling time cards, payroll, things like safety talks, all into one place, rather than having multiple applications, and hopefully save money along the way."*

**Key Points:**
- Desire for unified platform
- Integration of multiple functions
- Cost savings motivation

## **PROCORE MIGRATION STORIES**

### **Collins Construction**

**Current Situation:**
- Using Procore
- Finding it "big and clunky"
- Doesn't handle their specific workflows
- Team finds it overwhelming

**Interest in Appello:**
- Scheduling, workforce management, financial tracking features
- Modular pricing ($10/user/month + server costs + module fees)
- Early adopter and CAPI member discounts available
- Customer service, data security, flexible implementation emphasis

### **General Subcontractor Feedback**

**Ian's Observation:**
*"Our feedback is generally within subcontractor: they hate using it. They don't want to talk to those guys. They berate them at conferences."*

**Corey's Explanation:**
*"Procore is primarily for general contractors, and we are building for subcontractors. So there are actually a different target market, and the companies that use Appello have tried Procore. I found it did not work for them, because it's purpose-built for general contractors managing their subcontractors, as opposed to what Appello does, which is subcontractors managing their people."*

**Key Points:**
- Subcontractors hate Procore
- Public frustration at conferences
- Different target markets
- Appello customers have tried Procore and it didn't work
- Purpose-built difference matters

### **Migration Reasons**

**Why Contractors Switch:**
1. Procore built for GCs, not subs
2. Cost ($76K-$257K vs $10/user/month)
3. Implementation time (3-6 months vs 1-2 weeks)
4. Can't handle union payroll complexity
5. Poor support (ticket queues)
6. Field adoption resistance
7. Doesn't understand ICI workflows

**Appello Advantages:**
- Purpose-built for subcontractors
- Handles union complexity
- Faster implementation
- Better support
- Lower cost
- Field-friendly mobile app
