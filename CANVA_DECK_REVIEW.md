### **PAGE 7: Case Study - R.A. Barnes Electrical**
**Headline:** Case Study - How one electrical contractor streamlined operations and cut admin time in half

**Company:** ⚡ R.A. Barnes Electrical Contractors - London, Ontario

**Challenge:**
Communication issues. Managing schedules, timecards, and payroll across multiple apps was messy and slow. Admin staff spent hours every week chasing updates and fixing errors.

**Solution:**
Appello replaced six disconnected systems with one platform. Scheduling, timesheets, and safety tracking now happen in a single app — accessible anywhere.

**Results:**
- Tasks that took hours now take minutes
- The team eliminated a full-time admin role and saved thousands each year
- Field staff stay connected without endless calls or emails

**Quote:**
"Appello completely changed how we run our jobs. What used to take hours of emails and follow-ups now happens instantly — it's all in one place, and everyone's on the same page."
