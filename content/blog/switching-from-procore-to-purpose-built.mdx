# Why ICI Contractors Are Switching from Procore to Purpose-Built Software

At NIA conferences, subcontractors publicly confront Procore reps about software "built for GCs managing us as vendors, not for managing our own operations." ICI contractors are discovering that purpose-built software designed specifically for subcontractors offers better workflows, lower costs, and faster implementation than adapting GC-focused platforms.

## The Procore Problem

### Built for General Contractors

**The Reality:**
- Procore designed for GCs managing subcontractors
- Workflows don't match subcontractor operations
- Features focused on GC needs
- Subcontractors treated as afterthought
- Frustration with platform

**The Cost:**
- $76,000-$257,000 annually
- 3-6 month implementations
- Low user adoption
- Workarounds required
- Integration challenges

### Subcontractor Frustrations

**Common Complaints:**
- "Big and clunky"
- "More than we need"
- "Doesn't handle our workflows"
- "Field workers refuse to use it"
- "Feels like Big Brother tracking"

**Real Impact:**
- Low adoption rates
- Workarounds required
- Manual processes continue
- Frustrated teams
- Poor ROI

## Why Purpose-Built Software Wins

### 1. Workflow Fit

**Purpose-Built:**
- Designed for subcontractor operations
- Matches actual workflows
- Handles union payroll complexity
- Tracks equipment lifecycles
- Supports field-first operations

**Procore:**
- GC-focused workflows
- Doesn't handle union complexity
- Limited equipment tracking
- Office-centric design
- Workarounds required

**Result:** Purpose-built software feels natural, Procore feels forced.

### 2. Cost Comparison

**Procore:**
- $76,000-$257,000 annually
- 10-20x more expensive
- Implementation: 3-6 months
- Ongoing costs high

**Purpose-Built:**
- $10 per user per month
- Affordable for subcontractors
- Implementation: 1-2 weeks
- Predictable costs

**Example:**
- 50-user contractor
- Procore: $76,000-$257,000/year
- Purpose-built: $6,000/year
- **Savings: $70,000-$251,000 annually**

### 3. Implementation Speed

**Procore:**
- 3-6 month implementations
- Complex setup
- Extensive training
- Slow adoption
- High failure rate

**Purpose-Built:**
- 1-2 week implementations
- Simple setup
- Minimal training
- Fast adoption
- High success rate

**Result:** Purpose-built software goes live faster, Procore takes months.

### 4. User Adoption

**Purpose-Built:**
- Field workers actually use it
- Mobile-first design
- Simple interface
- Matches workflows
- High adoption

**Procore:**
- Field resistance
- Complex interface
- GC-focused features
- Low adoption
- Workarounds

**Result:** Purpose-built software gets used, Procore gets avoided.

## Real-World Use Cases for ICI Contractors

### Use Case 1: Collins Construction Finds Better Workflow Fit

A mid-sized mechanical contractor tried Procore for 6 months but found it "big and clunky," "more than we need," and "doesn't handle our workflows." The team found it overwhelming and adoption was low. After switching to purpose-built software designed specifically for subcontractors, workflow fit improved dramatically, implementation was faster, adoption increased significantly, ROI improved, and the team was happier. The contractor found software that matched their actual workflows rather than adapting to GC-focused processes.

### Use Case 2: Sheet Metal Contractor Saves $114,000 Annually

A 40-person sheet metal contractor used Procore for 1 year at $120,000 annual cost with low adoption. Field workers refused to use it, workarounds were required, manual processes continued, ROI was poor, and the team was frustrated. After switching to purpose-built software at $6,000 annual cost, adoption increased dramatically, workarounds eliminated, processes automated, and ROI improved significantly. The contractor saved $114,000 annually while improving operations through better software fit.

### Use Case 3: HVAC Contractor Improves Field Adoption

An HVAC contractor struggled with Procore adoption among field workers who found it too complex for their needs. Field workers avoided using the system, leading to continued manual processes and poor data quality. After switching to purpose-built software designed for field workers, adoption improved dramatically, field workers embraced the system, and data quality improved significantly. The contractor improved operations efficiency through better field adoption.

### Use Case 4: Mechanical Insulation Contractor Reduces Complexity

A mechanical insulation contractor found Procore too complex for their operations, requiring extensive training and ongoing support. The contractor spent significant time and resources on training and support without achieving desired adoption. After switching to purpose-built software with simpler workflows designed for subcontractors, complexity reduced dramatically, training time decreased, and adoption improved. The contractor improved efficiency through reduced complexity.

### Use Case 5: Multi-Trade Contractor Finds Purpose-Built Solution

A multi-trade contractor coordinating mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work struggled with Procore's GC-focused approach that didn't match subcontractor workflows. After switching to purpose-built software designed for subcontractors, workflows matched actual operations, processes improved, and efficiency increased. The contractor found software that understood subcontractor needs rather than GC requirements.
