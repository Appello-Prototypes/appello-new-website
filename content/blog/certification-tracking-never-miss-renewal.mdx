# Certification Tracking: Never Miss a Renewal Again

For ICI contractors, worker certifications are critical for compliance, safety, and job assignments. But when certifications are tracked manually in spreadsheets, renewals get missed, workers show up to jobs without required certifications, and compliance violations result in fines and lost work. According to [OSHA regulations](https://www.osha.gov/compliance), contractors must ensure workers have proper certifications for hazardous work, and violations can result in significant penalties. Automated certification tracking ensures renewals never get missed and workers are always certified for their assignments, maintaining compliance with [WHMIS requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/occupational-health-safety/workplace-hazardous-materials-information-system.html) and other regulatory standards.
