# QuickBooks Online + DEXT: Streamlining Receipt Management for Contractors

For ICI contractors, managing receipts is a constant challenge. Field workers collect receipts for materials, fuel, meals, and equipment—then those receipts pile up in the office, waiting to be manually entered into QuickBooks Online.
