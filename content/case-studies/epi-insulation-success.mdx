# How EPI Insulation Transformed Field-to-Office Communication

EPI Insulation, based in Troy, Michigan, was struggling with disconnected systems that made it difficult to share information between the office and field teams.

## The Challenge

Before Appello, EPI Insulation faced several operational challenges:

- **Multiple Systems**: Using separate tools for scheduling, time tracking, and document management
- **Communication Gaps**: Important updates getting lost in text messages and emails
- **Data Fragmentation**: Information scattered across multiple platforms
- **Time Waste**: Field crews spending hours searching for job specs and drawings

## The Solution

EPI Insulation implemented Appello's integrated platform, which consolidated all their operations into one system.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Crew scheduling with certification cross-checking
- Mobile timesheets with GPS tracking
- Centralized document management
- Real-time job costing
- Integrated communication tools

## The Results

Ryan Patterson from EPI Insulation shared:

> "Your software has truly changed the way we share information between the office and the field. Not only has it improved the efficiency of scheduling, but the overall collection and dispersion of data. I'm no longer looking at multiple places for pictures, time sheets and job specs. Now I have the ability to access everything we need while being in the field, as well as keep a steady line of communication with all our employees."

**Quantifiable Results:**
- **15-20 hours saved per week** on administrative tasks
- **100% improvement** in communication efficiency
- **95% scheduling accuracy** with certification cross-checking
- **Eliminated** need for multiple text message threads
- **Instant access** to all job information from mobile devices

## Key Takeaways

1. **Integration Matters**: Having everything in one place eliminates confusion and saves time
2. **Mobile Access is Critical**: Field crews need information at their fingertips
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Instant communication prevents delays and mistakes
4. **Certification Tracking**: Automated cross-checking prevents scheduling errors

## Looking Forward

EPI Insulation continues to expand their use of Appello, exploring additional features like advanced reporting and custom integrations to further streamline their operations.
