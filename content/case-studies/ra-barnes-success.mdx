# How R.A. Barnes Simplified Operations and Cut Admin Time in Half

R.A. Barnes Electrical Contractors, based in London, Ontario, transformed their operations by replacing six disconnected systems with Appello's integrated platform, dramatically reducing administrative overhead and improving field-to-office communication.

## The Challenge

Before Appello, R.A. Barnes faced significant operational inefficiencies:

- **Multiple Disconnected Systems**: Using six separate tools for scheduling, timecards, payroll, and communication
- **Communication Chaos**: Messy schedules and timecards scattered across multiple apps
- **Administrative Burden**: Administrative staff spending hours chasing updates and fixing errors
- **Inefficient Workflows**: Tasks that should take minutes were consuming hours of administrative time
- **Field Communication Issues**: Endless calls and emails to keep field staff connected

## The Solution

R.A. Barnes implemented Appello's unified platform, consolidating all operations into a single, accessible system.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Integrated scheduling accessible from anywhere
- Mobile timesheets and timecard management
- Centralized safety tracking
- Real-time communication tools
- Single-platform access for all operations

## The Results

Katharine Barnes, Vice President at R.A. Barnes, shared:

> "Appello completely changed how we run our jobs. What used to take hours of emails and follow-ups now happens instantly — it's all in one place, and everyone's on the same page."

**Quantifiable Results:**
- **50% reduction** in administrative time
- **Full-time admin role eliminated**, saving thousands annually
- **Tasks that took hours** now completed in minutes
- **Six systems consolidated** into one unified platform
- **Field staff stay connected** without endless calls or emails
- **Instant updates** replace hours of follow-up work

## Key Takeaways

1. **Consolidation Pays Off**: Replacing multiple systems with one platform eliminates redundancy and saves time
2. **Real-Time Communication**: Instant updates replace hours of email chains and phone calls
3. **Mobile Accessibility**: Field and office teams access everything they need from anywhere
4. **Cost Savings**: Eliminating administrative overhead directly impacts the bottom line
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Tasks that consumed hours now take minutes

## Looking Forward

R.A. Barnes continues to leverage Appello's integrated platform to streamline operations and maintain their competitive edge in the electrical contracting industry.
