# Transforming Payroll and Operations with One Connected Platform

Vanos Insulations, based in Mount Brydges, Ontario, transformed their payroll and administrative operations by replacing paper timesheets and multiple disconnected programs with Appello's integrated platform.

## The Challenge

Before Appello, Vanos Insulations faced significant operational challenges that made payroll processing feel like a full-time job:

- **Paper Timesheets**: Field crews filling out paper forms in their cars at job sites
- **Late Submissions**: Crews forgetting to submit timesheets or sending them in late
- **Multiple Disconnected Programs**: Using different software for every task
- **Endless Follow-Ups**: Administrative staff spending hours collecting information
- **Data Collection Burden**: The collection of information alone to run weekly payroll was a job in itself
- **Exhausting Workflow**: The process was so bad that staff blocked it out mentally

As Brianne Ernewein, Accounting & HR Manager, recalls:

> "Before Appello, payroll was chaos — we used paper time sheets, multiple programs, and spent hours every week just collecting information. It was exhausting. It was bad. I blocked it out — it was that bad."

## The Solution

Vanos Insulations implemented Appello's unified platform, specifically designed for their industry needs.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Centralized timecard management — digital, accurate, accessible from anywhere
- Integrated scheduling and payroll processing
- Real-time reporting and data access
- Instant support system with immediate response
- Mobile-first design for field crews

**Industry-Specific Design:**
The fact that Appello is based specifically on needs within their industry and similar industries made adoption seamless and effective.

## The Results

Since adopting Appello, Vanos Insulations has seen dramatic improvements:

**Operational Transformation:**
- **One person now runs payroll** — down from requiring multiple administrators
- **Two additional staff freed up** to focus on higher-value work
- **Tasks reduced from days to minutes** — what used to take days now happens in minutes
- **Accuracy is up, stress is down** — the whole operation runs smoother

**Support Excellence:**
- **Instant support response** — click a button, submit a question, get a response right away
- **No more waiting** for help when questions arise

**Workflow Impact:**
As Brianne explains:

> "Appello has changed the day-to-day workflow in our office drastically. Before Appello we used different programs for everything — guys filling in paper time sheets, filling them in like you know on their laps in their cars at a job site, sending it in late, oops they forgot to send it. The collection of information alone to run a weekly payroll was a job in itself."

> "Since adopting Appello, we have one person running payroll now, which frees up two other administrative people to continue on with day-to-day tasks. With Appello, anytime we need support or have a question within the program, click a button, submit a question, and then we get a response back right away. It's completely changed how our office runs."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Industry-Specific Design Matters**: Appello's focus on their industry needs made adoption natural and effective
2. **Eliminate Paper Processes**: Digital timesheets accessible from anywhere eliminate collection headaches
3. **Consolidation Creates Efficiency**: One platform replacing multiple programs dramatically reduces administrative overhead
4. **Free Up Resources**: Reducing payroll from multiple people to one frees staff for higher-value work
5. **Support Makes a Difference**: Instant support response eliminates frustration and downtime

## Looking Forward

Vanos Insulations continues to leverage Appello's integrated platform, enjoying smoother operations, reduced stress, and the ability to focus on growing their business rather than managing administrative chaos.
