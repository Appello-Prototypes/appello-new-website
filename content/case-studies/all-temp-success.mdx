# How All Temp Reduced Administrative Overhead by 30% and Set Field Teams Up for Success

All Temp, a mechanical insulation contractor serving Toronto's major institutions including University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Hospital, and Royal York Hotel, transformed their operations by replacing whiteboards and manual communication with Appello's integrated platform.

## The Challenge

Before Appello, All Temp struggled with disconnected workflows that created administrative burden and communication gaps:

- **Manual Scheduling Systems**: Using whiteboards and notebook pages to track jobs and assignments
- **Communication Breakdowns**: Having to remember to manually text updates to field workers
- **Information Scattered**: Job details, photos, drawings, and notes spread across multiple platforms
- **Administrative Overhead**: Significant time spent on manual data entry and communication
- **Field Team Delays**: Crews arriving on site without critical information, slowing down project starts

## The Solution

All Temp implemented Appello's unified platform, creating a centralized command center for all project operations.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Project File Organization**: Complete job details including location, start times, project contacts, and job descriptions uploaded ahead of time
- **Photo Documentation**: Site walk photos uploaded directly to project files for field team reference
- **Drawing Management**: Spec drawings accessible to field staff via mobile devices
- **Visual Scheduling Dashboard**: All current jobs, scheduled and unscheduled, visible in one place
- **Worker Assignment**: Easy assignment of workers to specific projects
- **Mobile Safety Forms**: Formal hazard assessments, lift inspections, and aerial platform inspections accessible from field phones
- **Notes Functionality**: Photo notes automatically logged to projects, eliminating need to remember to text updates
- **Job-Specific Timesheets**: Field workers submit timesheets to individual jobs, enabling accurate job costing
- **Project Map View**: Visual dashboard showing all active projects across the city

## The Results

Darren from All Temp shared:

> "I love having this dashboard of all our projects. It's like my little command center. I can see all of our projects. I don't know how I would do it any other way to be honest."

Sean, a field worker at All Temp, added:

> "I love it. It's a lot more organized, easier to access resources. It's overall a pretty good product. When you're doing your FHA, everybody's aware, all on the same page of the hazards and all your safety gear that you need."

**Quantifiable Results:**
- **30% reduction** in administrative overhead
- **100% improvement** in communication efficiency - no more forgotten text messages
- **Instant field readiness** - crews arrive with all information needed to hit the ground running
- **Centralized project organization** - multiple jobs at same location (like Sunnybrook Hospital) organized individually
- **Mobile safety compliance** - daily formal hazard assessments completed and reviewed through the platform
- **Eliminated whiteboards** - all scheduling now digital and accessible from anywhere

## Real-World Impact

**University of Toronto Project:**
- Site walk photos and drawings uploaded to project file before crews arrived
- Field teams had instant access to clearances, spacing requirements, and installation specs
- Crews hit the ground running on day one with complete project context

**Sunnybrook Hospital:**
- Multiple jobs at the same facility organized as individual projects
- Timesheets submitted to specific jobs for accurate job costing
- Notes and photos automatically logged to correct project files

**33 Young Street Restaurant:**
- Notes feature used to document when heat tracing was ready for insulation
- Field teams arriving days later had immediate access to project status updates
- No need to remember to text updates - information lives in the project file

## Key Takeaways

1. **Centralization Eliminates Chaos**: Moving from whiteboards to a digital dashboard creates a true command center
2. **Proactive Setup Wins**: Uploading all project information ahead of time ensures field teams are ready
3. **Automatic Logging**: Notes and photos automatically attached to projects eliminate forgotten communications
4. **Mobile-First Safety**: Safety forms accessible from field phones ensure compliance and awareness
5. **Visual Organization**: Map view and dashboard provide instant visibility into all operations
6. **Job-Level Tracking**: Individual project organization enables accurate job costing even at multi-project sites

## Looking Forward

All Temp continues to leverage Appello's platform, with plans to add equipment tracking to know where all ladders, pin guns, and tools are located across their projects. The foundation of centralized project management and communication has transformed how they operate.
